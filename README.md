# Language-Translator-in-Python
The Language Translator using Python is an application that can translate text from one language to another. It can be used to translate any text, from simple phrases to large documents.
The application will be developed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool. The user will be prompted to select the input language and output language, and then provide the text to be translated.
The project will include the following functionalities:
Language detection: The application will automatically detect the input language, if the user doesn't provide the input language.
Translation: The application will translate the input text from the input language to the output language selected by the user.
Multi-language support: The application will support multiple languages for input and output. Users can translate text from any language to any other language.
User-friendly interface: The application will have a simple and user-friendly interface that will guide the user throughout the translation process.
Error handling: The application will handle errors, such as invalid input or unsupported languages, and provide appropriate error messages.
Project goals:
Develop an application that can translate text from one language to another using Python.
Use external libraries to provide accurate translations.
Develop a user-friendly interface for the application.
Support multiple languages for input and output.
Handle errors and provide appropriate error messages.
